Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) are released into the cell's cytosol following the increase in permeability of the mitochondria membranes.

In the cytosol noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules.

Catecholamine release is stimulated by the activation","Enzymes can be compartmentalized with different metabolic pathways occurring in different cellular compartments.
