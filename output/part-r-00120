Two of these equations predicted the possibility and behavior of waves in the field. Analyzing the speed of these theoretical waves Maxwell realized that they must travel at a speed that was about the known speed of light. This startling coincidence in","the position of the vernal point on the celestial sphere changes over time and the equatorial and the ecliptic coordinate systems change accordingly.
